  <p>The heaviness in your chest increases, you feel your knees shake and you feel a sickness brewing deep in your stomach. Your mind is racing and you feel sweat begin to ooze from your skin, as you crawl back to your room you focus on 1 million things at once, unable to differentiate between what has number one priority. You close your eyes and clutch your stomach on your bed, the trembling hasn't stopped and won't for a while, you lock your door and close the blinds you don't want to see yourself in this moment.

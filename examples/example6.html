  <p>Nowadays you have trouble remembering anything, days blur into weeks, weeks blur into months. Everything moves faster than you know how to cope with, you need time to yourself to figure out how to fix this, but you already spend all the time you have by yourself. You're scared on the off days you feel something, any other day you find yourself numb, the pit within you is growing exponentially and you are becoming hopeless.

  <p>You get out of your bed and decide to have a shower to get ready for the day. You check your phone, 6 missed calls from flat mates and friends. You notice your room stinks and you realise you need to clean it, old plates and bowls stacked up around the place, you live in a squalor. You deserve this, this is how you have made it for yourself and you will exist this way.

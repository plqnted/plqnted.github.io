  <p>You wake up to an alarm you set for 12PM, assignment due dates hang over you but today you’re utterly exhausted.  You feel weak in your legs and you reach for a glass of water. After a few sips you sink back into your blankets and fall back to sleep. Your don’t dream and you wake up again at 4:46 PM. The day was gone before you had a chance to grab onto it.

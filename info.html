  <p>Sleep easy is an experimental project used to educate and start a conversation about how to face your own decline in mental health. While working at uni throughout this semester I found myself finding it harder to get out of bed each day and found my attendance at campus was decreasing significantly. Trying to stay above the water, keeping my mental health in check as well as trying to juggle my uni work has been an issue for me, but realising this and seeking help from friends has helped me grasp onto myself and continue on. I want this site to showcase what it feels like to feel your mental health declining and the pressure rising inside of your brain. 

    I chose the name “sleep easy” to reflect and make fun of the idea of how I personally find that it becomes more difficult to get to sleep and more difficult to wake up in the morning as I feel my mental health declining. I will use images of my own paintings to try and give a visual reference to how these sensations feel. Alongside with producing the music for each individual webpage to go hand in hand with the visuals and the messages displayed. I want the experience on the site to be unsettling but also to shine some light onto what feeling like this is like to people who dont experience these things on the same level. 
    
    Aesthetically, I want a grungy, digital and psychedelic mix. Using vibrant saturated colours over black or white backgrounds to create interesting contrasting effects, I will use my own images, paintings and drawings to show how I feel in these moments, hopefully showing others how these feelings can feel in more of a visual sense. I would like to eventually try to animate these using after effects and distort them for the webpage to fit in with this style more, but for now this is what I have.
    
    Each page spiderwebs as you go deeper and deeper into the site, the messages become more harrowing and the visuals get darker I would also like to try and have the music slow and distort as the user goes further into the site.</p>
